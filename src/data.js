        title: 'Traveling',
        text: ` Although, tourism  became widely affordable only in second half of last  century,it is now very popular throughout 
        the world. For about the last 60-70 years many people made use the openness of the countries , which was hard to get into 
        before.For the last years curiosity led people to places where before was only room for interests of scholars and diplomats.
        Many of us considers boring spending vacation at the local  resort areas.And so do I and prefere to spend my vacation 
        traveling around the world.My favorite activity is to take a ticket and fly as far away as possible or as allows my purse.
        This is not only mere escape from the concrete and glass of the city but treveling far is instructive,interesting,
        gives much pleasure,stays in memory for the long time.As for me it is important not only to go somewhere to seaside 
        to get sea bath but also get some more positive impressions.So I always try to go where not only the sea is different 
        but people and culture too differs in many ways.Before going anywhere I gather information about my future destination , 
        people,their religion,culture,traditions,architecture and other features of the country that might draw my interest.
        Being on vacation in an unknown country you can visit historic sites and other attractions,make acquaintance with
         interesting people both local and other tourists and delve into variety of activities on the sea.like diving,yachting,
         serfing and fishing.Although to some people it might seems a little dangerous,of all those activities the most appealing 
         as for me is diving.From my point of view,the best diving is at Marsa-Alam on the Red sea.Connoisseurs of this kind of sport
          came from many countries to spend an unforgetable time under water.One can imagine how intriguing to plunge into a warm water
           and then go deeper and deeper until you are surrounded by corals and can see the  variety of the underwater wildlife.
           All this covers your needs for physical strains in an entertaining way.`,

        title: 'Space and memory: the Viking edge.',
        text: ` Although the Vikings were well aware of surrounding world and they themselves come north from Europe, Europeans have scarce knowledge about those who lived at the northern frontiers of the world. An inclement weather and perilous sea made up an uneasy task to get through these waters to new lands.
            Old Norse seafarers managed to retain their ethnic identity in the world.They populated all surrounding isles between the western coast of Scandinavia and what is today known as Scotland and further over to Ireland. And eventually they reached Iceland in the 8th century, also spreading their attempts further to Greenland, and, as it goes, ventured to visit Newfoundland but couldn't to retain their presence there.
            They made use of a smart mnemonic device, that people exploited from pre-literary times, that is place naming. They have represented this idea in sagas, which initially were perceived through oral tradition. And as Islanders have a continuous tradition from the first settlements their sagas have been eventually committed to parchment about the 11th century. People apt to adopting this kind of behavior living in common social conditions. As it has been related in the article of Erik Erikson "Ontogeny of Ritualization" they are trying to form the so-called pseudo-specie.
             Most of the literary tradition of Icelanders consists of so-called Family sagas. Every saga has a steady exposition of the lineage of the heroes, their deeds and also places where they are living and acting. The sagas have become an important part of the national conscience of the new settlers of Iceland, thus creating a transition from communicative to cultural memory. This essence in general described in the article of Jan Assman "Collective memory and cultural identity". What kinds of purposes served and in which way cultural memory was formed by all these thrilling stories? First of all, it was extremely important for newly arising ethnos to convey to descendants their cultural connections, preserve the pantheon of gods and to convey all possible identity issues for the generations to come.
             In many sagas the life of gods described along with the interconnection of heroes deeds in a superstitious manner. It also was important not only to memorize their roots, but form, so to say, a new pantheon of heroes whose life promulgated a new historical reality. So most of the sagas are about this kind of heroes who succeeded to establish their settlements in the early period of colonization. Grettis saga is one of the examples. In here we can see how much attention paid to all places, geographical marks an so on.
             Another problem that sagas help to resolve is to avoid dangerous places, so to say, to keep out oneself of harm's way. As a rule, the Icelanders ascribed these places as being inhabited with all kinds of superstitious creatures, more often with trolls. they, in an otherworldly manner, were bringing harm to people who ventured to visit the places.
            One more reason why sagas have to be accounted for is a meticulous description of places where newcomer settled to live. It has a close connection to practical purposes for dwellers to establish transition of information to their descendants about the place they going to live in. Excellent example of this is Fóstbræðra saga, where we see how the find convenient sailing routes and how to avoid the tricky wind inside the fjord. Also, there pointed to the abundant places for fishing, and for many other landscape features, substantial description are given.
             So, as we see, the composing of sagas were a very important impact on the life of first dwellers of Iceland. Owing to the fact, much important information was retained and brought to our days about the settlement of the island thus helping them to become the united ethnic entity.

        title: "Iran:challenge of modernity.",
        text: `By the middle of 19th century european countries had achieved considerable success in industrial production and scientific
        innovation .From this point they started to move to democracy later in 20th century. It was different with Islamic world.
        They had delapidated economy, badly developed army and governmental institution.First step to keep pace with the West,which, 
        by the time ,became more and more prevailing on the internetionai stage in economy ,science and military affairs,was made by 
        Ottoman Empire. In 1839 sultan AbdulMejid issued the Tanzimat Fermany,which means reorganization.
        But for almost all muslim countries it was very difficult challenge,primarily psychologically,to accept the modernization,
        as it was being conducted by 'ethnically strange outsiders'(as in colonial countries like Tunisia and Morocco) and assumed 
        great transformations in society, which was strongly opposed due to religious principles.
          There are four conventional ways of adaptation They have been adopted and widely accepted by scholars when dealing with
        challenges which modernity poses before  Islamic countries.They are:
         1. Emulation/Secularism
         2. Religious reform
         3. Traditionalism
         4. Fundamentalism
        Let us look at Iran model of adaptation .It is now believed  the country adheres the fundamentalist way.Iran have taken this way 
        after The Islamic Revolution of 1979  when shah  Mohhamed Reza Pakhlavi,who ruled the country over last 40 years,was deposed and 
        Shia clergy seized power.
        Ayatholla  Ruholla Homeieni became The Supreme Leader of Islamic Republic of Iran.New constitution have been adopted where 
        many democratic notions have been neglected.
        It is not posible, within the confines of this tiny essay, to give the detailed consideration  about reasons which have led 
        to the revolution but the basic historical framework and milestones on the way to it must be mentioned.From old days ulama,
        the Shia clergy, have been exerted tremendous influence on the Persian(as country was known before WWII) society.
        Suffice it to mention the case with tabacco concession when Grand Ayatollah Mirza Hassan Shirazi issued fatwa against smoking,
        trading,cultivating of tabacco.From position of heavy smoker it seems moreover  impressible even stunning what influence 
        Grand Ayatollah enjoyed in society.And it is the clergy who in cooperation with small and medium traders,as it says,-
        'bazari people',forced to abdicate shah Mohhamad Ali whereupon the first constitution was adopted and Majles (parliament)
        was established.
        In the course of subsequent history many events happened which entailed irreversible changes in economy and political life.
        Oil was discovered,ruling dinasty was changed.Former cossak brigades oficer, Reza Khan , deposed Ahmad Shah Qajar, 
        the last Shah of the Qajar dinasty, and established a constitutional monarchy.British oil companies penetrated extensively 
        into the country.But Iran get a miserable ratio of revenues from oil extracted in the country by British companies.
        How the shah not tried he could not get the oil companies to pay more.
        Secular model of development was in deep crisis and after WWII the affairs became even worse.By this time Reza Shah was deposed and his son took throne.So in 1951  the government of Mohammad Mosaddegh nationalized the oil industry.But in  course of events  they couldn't sustain the control over the country. Britain and American inteligence services made coup d'etat.The shah ,previously deposed, was reinstated and west companies get their control over oil back.It was a crusial moment in transformation of public opinion in Iran toward americans. It became now very negative  because of the role their intelligences played out in the coup d'etat.
        Shah Mohhamad Reza tried his best to establish western way of living and pose himself as a secular ruler.He gave rights 
        to vote to women, tried to accomplish many social programs.But his 'White Revolution' failed.He was declining to more and more 
        coercive ruling.SAVAK(political police) was created and trained by american experts which added to people's hate to americans.
        To this the war of 1967,where Arab nations was defeated by Israil added  disillusionment  in emulation of the Western way.
        People objected against shah's rule.The clergy played prominent role in protest movement.Their leader Ayatollah Khomeieni 
        was detained and then sent to exile.That was the time when he arrives at the idea of velaet-e-faqeh (The Governance of Jurist) 
        or Islamic State.Subsequently, after revolution the constitution of Iran was written relying on his ideas.
        1979 became crusial in iranian society.After begining of protests shah fled from country.Revolution was supported by 
        broad political community from  all kind of leftist parties like islamic marxist and more moderate counterparts to extreme
        fundamentalistic followers of Ayatollah Homeiene. The new power was emerging.Step by step fundamentalists take more power, 
        forcing  the rest of the political parties to withdraw from taking decisions and eventually expelling them from politics.
        What is a velaet-e-faqeh ? 'The fundamental difference between Islamic government and constitutional monarchies and 
        republics is this:whereas the representatives of the people or the monarch in such regimes engage in legislation, in Islam 
        the legislative power and competence to establish laws belongs exclusively to God Almighty. The Sacred Legislator of Islam 
        is the sole legislative power.' as Ayatollah Khomeiene stated in his work.
        In the first weeks after revolution Khomeiene does much legistlative work.He announces that the Family Protection Law of 1967 
        is abrogated, bans women to be a judges and obliges to wear hejab in the workplace.Although the right to vote  for women wasn't 
        abolished  many other democratic freedoms never became a constitutional norm.Islam is a state religion.The only religions 
        allowed exept islam are:Christianity,Judaism and Zoroastrism the others strictly prohibited.
        After expelling from office the first elected president,Abolhassan Bonisadr, for incompetence, as was said,
        the power in country was entirely seized by clerics.Their power  is sustained ,by now, with a row of not elected institution 
        like the Council of Guardians and the Expediency Council which elect a Supreme Leader.For supression of dissent have been 
        established the Special Court of Clergy,which isn't subordinate to any branch of power except the Supreme Leader.
        Clergy enjoys immence influence in public life.They subordinated to themselves all economic development, army and govermental 
        institutions.As Ayatollah Khomeiene used to say:'Islamic goverment does not correspond to any of the existing forms of government'. 
        And it's true indeed. As it is approached in media we see in Iran an emergence of new form of goverment,-the clerical oligarchy.'`,
