               You can see what we’ll be building here: Final Result. If the code doesn’t make sense to you,
               or if you are unfamiliar with the code’s syntax, don’t worry! The goal of this tutorial 
               is to help you understand React and its syntax.
               We recommend that you check out the tic-tac-toe game before continuing with the tutorial. 
               One of the features that you’ll notice is that there is a numbered list to the right of the game’s board. 
               This list gives you a history of all of the moves that have occurred in the game, 
               and it is updated as the game progresses.
               You can close the tic-tac-toe game once you’re familiar with it. 
               We’ll be starting from a simpler template in this tutorial. 
               Our next step is to set you up so that you can start building the game.`,

            text: `A Hook is a special function that lets you “hook into” React features. For example,
            useState is a Hook that lets you add React state to function components. We’ll learn other Hooks later.
            When would I use a Hook? If you write a function component and realize you need to add some state to it, 
            previously you had to convert it to a class. Now you can use a Hook inside the existing function component. 
            We’re going to do that right now!`,
