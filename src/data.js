        text: ` Although tourism  became widely affordable only in second half of last  century,it is now very popular throughout 
        the world. For about the last 60-70 years many people made use the openness of the countries , which was hard to get into 
        before.For the last years curiosity led people to places where before was only room for interests of scholars and diplomats.
        Many of us considers boring spending vacation at the local  resort areas.And so do I and prefere to spend my vacation 
        traveling around the world.My favorite activity is to take a ticket and fly as far away as possible or as allows my purse.
        This is not only mere escape from the concrete and glass of the city but treveling far is instructive,interesting,
        gives much pleasure,stays in memory for the long time.As for me it is important not only to go somewhere to seaside 
        to get sea bath but also get some more positive impressions.So I always try to go where not only the sea is different 
        but people and culture too differs in many ways.Before going anywhere I gather information about my future destination , 
        people,their religion,culture,traditions,architecture and other features of the country that might draw my interest.
        Being on vacation in an unknown country you can visit historic sites and other attractions,make acquaintance with
         interesting people both local and other tourists and delve into variety of activities on the sea.like diving,yachting,
         serfing and fishing.Although to some people it might seems a little dangerous,of all those activities the most appealing 
         as for me is diving.From my point of view,the best diving is at Marsa-Alam on the Red sea.Connoisseurs of this kind of sport
          came from many countries to spend an unforgetable time under water.One can imagine how intriguing to plunge into a warm water
           and then go deeper and deeper until you are surrounded by corals and can see the  variety of the underwater wildlife.
           All this covers your needs for physical strains in an entertaining way.`,

        title: 'Space and memory: the Viking edge.',
        text: ` Although the Vikings were well aware of surrounding world and they themselves come north from Europe, Europeans have scarce knowledge about those who lived at the northern frontiers of the world. An inclement weather and perilous sea made up an uneasy task to get through these waters to new lands.
            Old Norse seafarers managed to retain their ethnic identity in the world.They populated all surrounding isles between the western coast of Scandinavia and what is today known as Scotland and further over to Ireland. And eventually they reached Iceland in the 8th century, also spreading their attempts further to Greenland, and, as it goes, ventured to visit Newfoundland but couldn't to retain their presence there.
            They made use of a smart mnemonic device, that people exploited from pre-literary times, that is place naming. They have represented this idea in sagas, which initially were perceived through oral tradition. And as Islanders have a continuous tradition from the first settlements their sagas have been eventually committed to parchment about the 11th century. People apt to adopting this kind of behavior living in common social conditions. As it has been related in the article of Erik Erikson "Ontogeny of Ritualization" they are trying to form the so-called pseudo-specie.
             Most of the literary tradition of Icelanders consists of so-called Family sagas. Every saga has a steady exposition of the lineage of the heroes, their deeds and also places where they are living and acting. The sagas have become an important part of the national conscience of the new settlers of Iceland, thus creating a transition from communicative to cultural memory. This essence in general described in the article of Jan Assman "Collective memory and cultural identity". What kinds of purposes served and in which way cultural memory was formed by all these thrilling stories? First of all, it was extremely important for newly arising ethnos to convey to descendants their cultural connections, preserve the pantheon of gods and to convey all possible identity issues for the generations to come.
             In many sagas the life of gods described along with the interconnection of heroes deeds in a superstitious manner. It also was important not only to memorize their roots, but form, so to say, a new pantheon of heroes whose life promulgated a new historical reality. So most of the sagas are about this kind of heroes who succeeded to establish their settlements in the early period of colonization. Grettis saga is one of the examples. In here we can see how much attention paid to all places, geographical marks an so on.
             Another problem that sagas help to resolve is to avoid dangerous places, so to say, to keep out oneself of harm's way. As a rule, the Icelanders ascribed these places as being inhabited with all kinds of superstitious creatures, more often with trolls. they, in an otherworldly manner, were bringing harm to people who ventured to visit the places.
            One more reason why sagas have to be accounted for is a meticulous description of places where newcomer settled to live. It has a close connection to practical purposes for dwellers to establish transition of information to their descendants about the place they going to live in. Excellent example of this is Fóstbræðra saga, where we see how the find convenient sailing routes and how to avoid the tricky wind inside the fjord. Also, there pointed to the abundant places for fishing, and for many other landscape features, substantial description are given.
             So, as we see, the composing of sagas were a very important impact on the life of first dwellers of Iceland. Owing to the fact, much important information was retained and brought to our days about the settlement of the island thus helping them to become the united ethnic entity.
